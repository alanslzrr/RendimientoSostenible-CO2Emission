# SustainablePerformance-CO2Emission

### Data Theme Description
In this project, we aim to assess the significant environmental impact due
to the considerable emission of Carbon Dioxide under driving cycle (CO2) and the high
country-level fuel demand for combustion-based vehicles.

Data will also consider differentiating factors in emissions and
fuel consumption among vehicles, such as; Brand, Type, Engine Capacity,
Consumption, Fuel Type, among others, allowing the identification of any
common variable.

This was conducted using a "Greenhouse Gas Tests and Consumption" database, provided by the "Ministry of Environment and Sustainable
Development. Coordination of Vehicle Emissions" with a list of 864
various brands and models, where values were provided by
different Laboratories that conducted a specific test on each vehicle.

### Hypothesis
The project's purpose is to make visible and raise awareness about the severity of
emissions, where CO2 is the main greenhouse gas on
our planet, along with the strong fuel demand caused by
vehicles. To achieve this, the data will be very useful as they
provide real values for each vehicle, such as CO2 Emission in
g/km unit, Fuel consumption in urban/extra-urban areas,
as well as a mixed consumption, lts/100km, allowing the identification of each vehicle
with certain variables, specifically, <a higher engine capacity, higher
consumption and emission>.

Overall, the aim is to provide valuable information about the carbon footprint
of the transportation sector with the capability of helping lawmakers, vehicle
manufacturers, and individuals to **understand** and **reduce** their emissions.

### Scope
- Support decision-making for environmental organizations, where they can
identify the most effective ways to reduce anthropogenic contaminations.

- Intend to further encourage the arrival of electric and hybrid cars in our
country, being one of the least advanced, with minimal production and having
few charging points across the country.

## Understanding of Files

- **Dashboard_SustainablePerformance.pbix** In this file, you will find the final dashboard in the PowerBI application.
- **Documentation_SustainablePerformance.pdf** This document details all the steps implemented in the project. I recommend reading it for a better understanding of the dashboard.
- **PowerBiService-Sustainable Performance** This file contains the link to the project for viewing and interacting with the dashboard without needing the PowerBI application installed.
